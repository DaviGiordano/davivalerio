I have started doing code katas, inspired by a video Emily Bache did at the Modern Software Engineering YouTube channel ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZW4AEKbHE28)). These are actually quite fun, and I have found them to be a neat way to get into Test Driven Development.

Here is my solution for the Leap Years code kata ([problem link](https://sammancoaching.org/kata_descriptions/leap_years.html)):

```python
import pytest


def is_leap_year(year: int):
    if year <= 0:
        raise ValueError("Year must be greater than 0")
    if not isinstance(year, int):
        raise TypeError("Year must be int")

    if (year % 100 == 0) and not (year % 400 == 0):
        return False
    elif year % 4 == 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False


@pytest.mark.parametrize(
    "year, expected",
    [
        (1901, False),  # Not divisible by 4
        (2004, True),  # Divisible by 4, not 100
        (2100, False),  # Divisible by 100, not 400
        (2000, True),  # Divisible by 100 and 400
    ],
)
def test_leap_year_rules(year, expected):
    assert is_leap_year(year) is expected


def test_negative_year():
    year = -100
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        is_leap_year(year)


def test_non_int():
    with pytest.raises(TypeError):
        print(is_leap_year(3.4))

```
